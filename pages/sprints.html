<h2>Sprint 0</h2>
<h3>Project Concept</h3>

<p>The project is to develop a tool to help visualize the set of relations between people where the relations can occur over a continuous amount of time, or be instantaneous, and where the people have life spans. The algorithm to determine the geometry of the rendering is more important than the actual rendering itself.</p>

<h3>Project Tweet</h3>

<p>A data visualization that is a systemic, volumetric model of human networks, revealing their evolution over time</p>

<h3>Personas</h3>

<p>The personas for this project would be our client Will Bosley who is the general manager of the Digital Innovation Lab. Others in the lab too will use our project. He is the user of the model. He wants to be able to look at relationships in a network systematically. The only way he can visualize relationships right now is centric to one individual, or can look at 2 dimensional connections. He wants to see the entire dataset so he can determine whether one node is hyperconnected.</p>

<h3>Use cases</h3>

<p>A person may have a dataset containing data that involves letters of correspondence between a family. They want to visualize their dataset and make observations about who corresponds the most amongst other family members at different times in the dataset. They upload their dataset in a format provided by the client and the program creates the geometry of the model that could be used to create a visual rendering on a website.</p>

<h3>Development Environment</h3>

        <p>Javascript in the browser and python jupyter notebook</p>

<h3>Functional Specs</h3>

        <p>Program generates geometry of a visual representation of a dataset where there are relations between people where the edges and people have a time element.</p>

<p>The model has time as the z-axis</p>
<p>Visual representations of people are columns</p>
<p>Columns cannot overlap on the x-y plane</p>
<p>Relations, or edges, are represented as planes between the columns or lines if the relation is instantaneous</p>
<h3>Extra goals</h3>

        <p>The actual rendering of the model has parameters the user can manipulate to control what kinds of relations appear, which people to include/exclude, ways to rotate and zoom in/out, etc.</p>

<h3>Prototype</h3>

<p>Prototype was developed in Jupyter Notebook. We need to modify it however, because a single entity overtime should be represented in a 3d format, so it will take the representation of a cylinder rather than a single point. </p>
